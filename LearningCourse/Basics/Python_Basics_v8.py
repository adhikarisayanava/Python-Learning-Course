#Use Python semaphore to control the number of threads that can access a shared resource simultaneously.
#Semaphore : A semaphore helps prevent thread synchronization issues like race conditions,
# where multiple threads attempt to access the resource at the same time and interfere with each otherâ€™s operations.
#A semaphore has two main operations:
    #Acquire: the acquire operation checks the count and decrement it if it is greater than zero. If the count is zero, the semaphore will block the thread until another thread releases the semaphore.
    #Release: the release operation increments the counts that allow other threads to acquire it.
